#  Assessing Spatial Disparities: A Bayesian Linear Regression Approach

This repository contains code implementation for detecting spatial disparities in a BYM2 model using the methodology discussed in the reference below.

A real data analysis example is included to showcase detecting disparities in estimates of lung cancer mortality rates in 2014 between neighboring US counties after accounting for estimates of total (non-daily and daily) smoking prevalence in 2012.

### Roadmap of the Repository

| Directory | Contents/Description |
| --- | --- |
| *src* | contains source code to setup simulation and data analysis, implement sampling algorithms, and analyze difference boundaries |
| *data* | contains data used in Section 5 of the manuscript |
| *test* | contains simulation and data analysis `R` scripts for all results and figures in the manuscript |
| *output* | contains all results and figures from simulation and data analysis scripts output from scripts in *test*|

# Reproducing Figures

Due to the IHME's data use agreement, we cannot share the data as part of the repository. To reproduce the figures, please download the datasets using the URLs listed above and save the main data files (containing the relevant estimates) at the following locations:

- Cancer mortality estimate data: `data/US_data/IHME_county_cancer_mortality.xlsx`
- Smoking prevalence data: `data/US_data/IHME_data/IHME_US_COUNTY_TOTAL_AND_DAILY_SMOKING_PREVALENCE_1996_2012.csv`

We provide several R files that reproduce the results and figures in the simulation examples and real data analysis example in the manuscript. For the simulation and real data analysis files, we describe the data used, the model utilized, and the corresponding section in the manuscript where the figures appear. For a majority of the files, we list R Markdown files that may be more accessible but produce equivalent results to the R scripts.
